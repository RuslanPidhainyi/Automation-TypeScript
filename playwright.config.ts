 *   regression - does the whole behaviour still hold?           nightly, 3 browsers
 *   e2e        - does the UI's data actually match what's in the DB?  chromium, needs direct SQL Server access
 *   api        - does every route let in exactly the right callers?   no browser, needs only the API
 *   database   - do the schema and the data keep their invariants?    no browser, needs only SQL Server
 *   accessibility - does axe-core find no violation on any screen?  chromium
 *   visual     - do the data-free screens still look the same?      chromium, local only (Windows baselines)
 *
 *   npm run test:health | test:smoke | test:regression | test:e2e | test:api | test:database | test:a11y | test:visual
